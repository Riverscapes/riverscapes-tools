    Main function to calculate the level path for each reach in a single watershed.

    This function parses command-line arguments, sets up logging, and performs
    level path calculations on a specified watershed within a hydrological GeoPackage.

    Command-line Arguments:
        hydro_gpkg (str): Path to the hydrological GeoPackage file.
        watershed_id (int): Identifier for the watershed to process.
        reset_first (str): Whether to reset the level path calculation before starting 
                           ('true' or 'false').

    Steps:
    1. Parses command-line arguments.
    2. Sets up a log file for tracking the process.
    3. Logs the input parameters.
    4. Connects to the GeoPackage database and retrieves existing triggers.
    5. Drops triggers, performs level path calculations, and restores triggers.
    6. Commits changes to the database or rolls back in case of an error.

    Raises:
