BRAT can be used at two different levels. Most users will want to access data from existing BRAT runs to use the outputs. These outputs were generated using nationally available input datasets, and cover large spatial extents. More advanced users may want to run the BRAT model themselves in order to adjust parameters or use higher resolution, regional datasets.
