BRAT is a command line tool. There is currently no user interface. However, [BRAT is architected]({{ site.baseurl}}/Technical_Reference/architecture.html) as three separate Python scripts that are easy to run once you have [installed]({{ site.baseurl}}/Technical_Reference/installation.html) all the necessary prerequisites. This page describes the inputs required to run each of the three Python scripts. You can also refer to the code itself which has more succinct descriptions.
