The **Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool** (BRAT) is planning tool intended to help researchers, restoration practitioners and resource managers assess the potential for beaver as a stream conservation and restoration agent over large regions and watersheds. At the heart of BRAT is a capacity model, which estimates the upper limit of dam density (dams per kilometer) for individual stream reaches throughout a drainage network. We focus on predicting where beavers could build dams and to what extent (as opposed to the more general case of where beaver could make a living), because it is the dam building activity they do as ecosystem engineers, which we are typically most interested in.

BRAT's backbone consists of **spatial models that predict the capacity of riverscapes to support dam-building activity by beaver**. By combining capacity and potential risk, researchers and resource managers have the information necessary to determine where and at what level reintroduction of beaver and/or conservation is appropriate.
