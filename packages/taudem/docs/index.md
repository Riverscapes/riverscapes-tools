[Terrain Anlysis Using Digital Elevation Models (TauDEM)](https://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/) is a suite of tools developed by David Tarboton at Utah State University's Hydrology Research Group. The [Riverscapes compliant](https://docs.riverscapes.net/standards
), [Production Grade](https://docs.riverscapes.net/standards
) TauDEM, utilizes some of the useful TauDEM algorithms, packaging inputs and outputs into a Riverscapes project that can be accessed as a product of its own, or used as inputs to other Riverscapes tools.

Riverscapes TauDEM projects take an input DEM and a channel and produce the following outputs using TauDEM algorithms:
- Pit-filled DEM
- D-infinity flow direction raster
- D-infinity contributing area raster
- Topographic Wetness Index ([TWI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_wetness_index))
- Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) raster
- D-infinity slope raster (percent)
- Additionally, produces a D-8 slope raster (degrees) using [GDAL](https://gdal.org/).
