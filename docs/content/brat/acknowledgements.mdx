# Financial Support

We have been fortunate to secure financial support for BRAT from a variety of state and federal agencies, tribes, and non-profit organization that have enabled BRAT development. Most of these grants were primarily to get BRAT ‘run’ for their specific areas of interest. However, in each case there have been refinements and improvements to the model to meet the sponsor’s specific needs. We have insisted on making data from BRAT runs vetted [publicly available](./data), and to transparently make the models freely available as well as the [source code open source](https://github.com/Riverscapes/pyBRAT)  (especially when funds are from public sources).

# Original Development
<div class="float-right"><a href="https://wildlife.utah.gov"></a></div> BRAT development and implementation for the entire state of Utah was funded by the [Utah Division of Wildlife Resources](https://wildlife.utah.gov/)  (USU Award No. 130940). We are grateful to John Shivik (former UDWR Fur Bearer Coordinator) and Kent Sorenson for investing in this effort.

## BRAT Pilot

<div class="float-right"><a href="http://www.grandcanyontrust.org/"></a></div> Initial development of BRAT was funded through a [pilot project](http://etal.joewheaton.org/gct-pilot-study-testing-the-beaver-restoration-assessment-tool-brat.html) granted to Utah State University (USU Award Control No. 120353) from the [Grand Canyon Trust](http://www.grandcanyontrust.org/) based on a grant from the [Walton Family Foundation](http://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/). We are grateful to Mary O'Brien for having the foresite to see what BRAT could be and invest in this intial effort.
