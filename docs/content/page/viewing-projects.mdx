# Viewing/Exploring Riverscapes Projects

Riverscapes projects can be viewed using the free Riverscapes Viewer. The Viewer is available in three varieties:

- [Web Viewer](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/software-help/help-web/), a web GIS that can be used to explore riverscapes projects in a web browser. To open projects in the Web Viewer, simply click on the globe icon next to the project in the [data exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net).
- [Riverscapes Viewer for QGIS users](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/software-help/help-qgis/).
- [Riverscapes Viewer for ArcGIS ](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/software-help/help-arc/).

When using the Viewer for QGIS or ArcGIS, import the project by clicking on the `Open Riverscapes Project` button in the plugin, navigating to the project folder, and selecting the project.rs.xml file. This will bring in the entire project, structured into a project tree, along with all of the default symbology to visualize input, output, and intermediate layers.
