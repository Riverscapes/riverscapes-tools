This report card communicates the Channel Area Tool's compliance with the Riverscape Consortium's published [tool standards](https://riverscapes.net/Tools).

# Report Card Summary

| Tool | [Channel Area Tool](https://tools.riverscapes.net/channel) |
| Version | [1.1.1](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/tree/master/packages/channel) |
| Date | 2021-11-22 |
| Assessment Team | Bailey, Wheaton & Gilbert |
| Current Assessment | ![production](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-website/master/assets/images/tools/grade/TRL_5_32p.png) [Production Grade](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/#tool-grade) |
| Target Status | ![production](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-website/master/assets/images/tools/grade/TRL_6_32p.png) Production Grade |
| Riverscapes Compliance | ![Compliant](https://riverscapes.net/assets/images/rc/RiverscapesCompliant_24.png) Compliant|
| Assessment Rationale | The tool has been run for a wide geographic area, produces riverscapes projects that are compatible with [RAVE](https://rave.riverscapes.net), and outputs are available in the riverscapes warehouse. Documentation is still needed, but the tool qualifies for Production Grade. |

**Evaluation Key:**
None or Not Applicable: <i class="fa fa-battery-empty" aria-hidden="true"></i> •
Minimal or In Progress: <i class="fa fa-battery-quarter" aria-hidden="true"></i> •
Functional: <i class="fa fa-battery-half" aria-hidden="true"></i> •
Fully Developed: <i class="fa fa-battery-full" aria-hidden="true"></i>  

| Criteria | Value | Evaluation | Comments and/or Recommendations |
|----------|-------|------------|---------------------------------|
| :------- | :---- | :--------  | :------------------------------ |
| Tool Interface(s) | <i class="fa fa-terminal" aria-hidden="true"></i> : CLI = [Command Line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) | <i class="fa fa-battery-full" aria-hidden="true"></i> |  |
| Scale | Network (reach scale resolution, watershed extent) | <i class="fa fa-battery-full" aria-hidden="true"></i> | This tool has been applied across watersheds in various regions; results are reach-scale performed across whole watersheds |
| Language(s) and Dependencies | Python | <i class="fa fa-battery-full" aria-hidden="true"></i> | Package dependencies are open source |
| Vetted in Peer-Reviewed Literature | The equation used to estimate channel width in areas without NHD polygons is from  [Beechie and Imaki (2013)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013WR013629) | <i class="fa fa-battery-half" aria-hidden="true"></i> | The width equation used in the tool has been reliable in a variety of landscapes, but was developed for the Columbia River Basin and may give poor results in different landscapes |
| Source Code Documentation | Available at [Github repository](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscaps-tools/channel) <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> | <i class="fa fa-battery-full" aria-hidden="true"></i> | Source code is clearly organized and documented |

| Easy User Interface | Tool is accessed via command prompt | <i class="fa fa-battery-quarter" aria-hidden="true"></i> | Most projects right now are performed by North Arrow Research analysts. For a user to run this version of the tool themselves would require advanced understanding (programming capability) and significant documentation on the process. |
| Scalability | Batch-processing | <i class="fa fa-battery-full" aria-hidden="true"></i> | The tool can be batch processed at the HUC 8 level |
| Produces Riverscapes Projects | Yes | <i class="fa fa-battery-full" aria-hidden="true"></i> | Produces Riverscapes Projects that are fully-compatible with [RAVE](https://rave.riverscapes.net) |

## Developer Intent
The current **Production Grade** version of Channel Area improves on previous versions by:
- Having an inviting [web-map interface](https://riverscapes.net/Data_Warehouses/#web-maps) so non GIS-users can discover tool runs and explore and interrogate them.
- Making it easy for GIS users to download channel area [projects](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/) for use in [RAVE](https://rave.riverscapes.net) 
- Allowing discovery of past Channel Area runs in Warehouse

The development team envision a **Professional Grade** version of Channel Area, which would additionally:
- Encourage more user-interaction with Channel Area outputs and crowd-sourcing of information to improve the accuracy of outputs
- Allow users to upload their own Channel Area projects
