# RC Production-Grade, Network-Scale Tools

Welcome to the documentation for the [Riverscape Consortium's](https://riverscapes.net) own production-grade family of network-scale riverscape models. These are riverscapes-compliant tools, which have been refactored to be capable of running in the cloud over regional, state-wide and/or nation-wide extents, while still resolving predictions of what is happening in individual reaches (i.e. 100 m to 500 m length scales) of riverscape.

Unlike some of our operational-grade and professional-grade GIS tools, which "users" run the models themselves in desktop GIS, these tools are run centrally in the cloud and their outputs are consumed by users through the [Riverscapes Viewer](http://viewer.riverscapes.net) in the web browser or through desktop GIS. Users can access tool outputs, which our packaged as riverscapes projects in our [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net/).

# The Waterfall

The tools listed above can be chained together to create a "waterfall" that produces a riverscapes project. The Riverscapes Context tool is the first tool in the waterfall, and it is used to create a series of riverscapes projects focused on different aspects of riverscape health. 

All models depend on an initial [Riverscapes Context](/rscontext) project that collects together the prerequisite national datasets for a given watershed. The dependencies of the other tools are shown in the waterfall diagram below. The [Riverscapes Metric Engine](/rme) collatates metrics from the other tools to create a comprehensive assessment of riverscape health based on Discreet and Integrated Geographic Objects (DGO and IGO respectively).

# Support

The Riverscapes Consortium is committed to supporting users and consumers of these tool outputs. We encourage questions regarding tools and their use through our online support forum [here](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/discussions). A free GitHub account is required to post to the [discussion board](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/discussions) but you can browse without an account.
