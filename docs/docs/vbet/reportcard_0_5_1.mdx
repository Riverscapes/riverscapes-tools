  <tr>
    <th>Assessment Rationale</th>
    <td>VBET has been applied extensively throughout the Western US and beyond. Continued development will improve output quality and applicability to a wider range of landscapes. The tool can be run at large scales and produces RAVE compatible riverscapes projects that are housed in the warehouse. Additional documentation is needed, but the tool qualifies for a Production Grade.</td>

# Report Card Details

This tool's [discrimination](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/#model-discrimination) evaluation by the [Riverscapes Consortium](https://riverscapes.net) is:

| Criteria | Value | Evaluation | Comments and/or Recommendations |
| :------- | :---- | :--------  | :------------------------------ |
| Tool Interface(s) | [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) | Pass |  |
| Scale | Catchment scale | Pass | Parameters are applied at reach scales, while the tool is applied to, and valley bottoms generated for whole watersheds |
| Language(s) and Dependencies | Python | Pass | Package dependencies are open source |
| Vetted in Peer-Reviewed Literature | The initial publication for the earliest version was [Gilbert et al, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300416301935?casa_token=30MuqKWJb_sAAAAA:5PH7YWnUUGUKaaBhJGnE44uJqXq_hU8z6TUHkGrEU3WL4B4T0nj9bslVTTIKsl-cyPF67EdIUDc) | Partial | The newer versions have not been officially published, but are improvements upon the published original version |
| Source Code Documentation | Available at [Github repository](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/tree/master/packages/vbet)<i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> | Pass | Source code is clearly organized and documented |
| Open Source | [open-source](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/tree/master/packages/vbet) <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> with [GNU General Public License v 3.0](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/blob/master/LICENSE) | Pass | |
| User Documentation | [Documentation](http://tools.riverscapes.net/vbet/) is in progress | Partial | Documentation is in progress but has not been published to the website |
| Easy User Interface | Tool is accessed via command prompt | Partial | The tool is primarily run by North Arrow Research analysts. For a user to run this version of the tool themselves would require advanced understanding (programming capability) and significant documentation on the process. |
| Scalability | batch-processing | Pass | Tool is typically batch processed at the HUC 8 level |
| Produces Riverscapes Projects | Yes | Pass | Produces Riverscapes Projects that are fully-compatible with [RAVE](https://rave.riverscapes.net) |

## Tool Output Utility

| Criteria | Value | Evaluation | Comments |
| :------- | :---- | :--------- | :------- |
| [RAVE](https://rave.riverscapes.net)- Compliant Riverscapes Projects | Yes | Pass | |
| [RAVE](https://rave.riverscapes.net) Business Logic Defined | Yes | Partial | Development is ongoing for some outputs (e.g., valley center line), which are not yet included in the business logic |
| Riverscapes Projects hosted in public-facing [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net)  | Yes. Current VBET projects are being housed in the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net). | Partial | There is data in the warehouse, but is provisional and wider access to the warehouse is forthcoming |
| Riverscapes Projects connected to [Web-Maps](https://riverscapes.net/software-help/help-web) <i class="fa fa-map-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> | Yes | Pass | Current projects are viewable in [WebRAVE](https://rave.riverscapes.net/Download/install_webrave.html) through the Riverscapes Warehouse |
| Riverscapes Projects connected to Field [Apps](https://docs.riverscapes.net/category/products) | No | Fail |  |
