## DGO/IGO Fields 

Field|Data Type|Units|Description
---|---|---|---
`level_path`*|TEXT|N/A|Unique identifier for a given stream from where it begins to where it ends
`seg_distance`|REAL|Meters|Distance along a given level_path. The combination of level path and seg_distance uniquely identifies a DGO/IGO
`segment_area`|REAL|Square meters|Area of the DGO 
`centerline_length`|REAL|Meters|Length of the centerline of the DGO/analysis window
`window_area`|REAL|Square meters|Area of the analysis window (a group of DGOs)
`FCode`*|INTEGER|N/A|A code representing the flow type (e.g., perennial, intermittent, ephemeral) for the main flowline within the DGO/analysis window

`*` These fields are NHD fields that are used by default, but in custom runs that utilize different datasets, can be substituted for other field names.

## Metrics

The following metrics are calculated individually for each DGO polygon and/or within an analysis window (comprised of several DGOs) and attributed to the corresponding IGO point.

Field|Metric|Data Type|Units|Description
---|---|---|---|---
`active_channel_area`|Active Channel Area|REAL|Square meters|Total area of active channel within the DGO/analysis window
`active_channel_prop(ortion)`|Active Channel Proportion|REAL|Ratio|Proportion of DGO/analysis window that is active channel
`floodplain_area`|Floodplain Area|REAL|Square meters|Total area of floodplain (valley bottom - active channel) within the DGO/analysis window
`floodplain_prop(ortion)`|Floodplain Proportion|REAL|Ratio|Proportion of DGO/analysis window that is floodplain
`low_lying_floodplain_area`|Low-Lying Floodplain Area|REAL|Square meters|Total area of low-lying floodplain within the DGO/analysis window
`low_lying_floodplain_prop(ortion)`|Low-Lying Floodplain Proportion|REAL|Ratio|Proportion of DGO/analysis window that is topographically low-lying floodplain
`elevated_floodplain_area`|Elevated Floodplain Area|REAL|Square meters|Total area of elevated Floodplain within the DGO/analysis window
`elevated_floodplain_prop(ortion)`|Elevated Floodplain Proportion|REAL|Ratio|Proportion of DGO/analysis window that is elevated floodplain
`integrated_width`|Integrated Width|REAL|Meters|Integrated width calculated as window_area / centerline length (average width of the DGO/analysis window)
`active_channel_itgr_width`|Active Channel Integrated Width|REAL|Meters|Active channel area divided by centerline length within the DGO/analysis window (average width of active channel)
`floodplain_itgr_width`|Floodplain Integrated Width|REAL|Meters|Floodplain area divided by centerline length within the DGO/analysis window (average width of floodplain)
`vb_acreage_per_mile`|Valley Bottom Acreage per Mile|REAL|acres/mile|Window area converted to acres and divided by centerline length converted to miles
`vb_hectares_per_km`|Valley Bottom Hectares per Kilometer|REAL|hectares/km|Window area converted to hectares and divided by centerline length converted to kilometers

`low_lying_acreage_per_mile`|Low-Lying Acreage per Mile|REAL|acres/mile|Low-lying floodplain area converted to acres and divided by centerline length converted to miles
`low_lying_hectares_per_km`|Low-Lying Hectares per Kilometer|REAL|hectares/km|Low-lying floodplain area converted to hectares and divided by centerline length converted to kilometers
`elevated_acreage_per_mile`|Elevated Acreage per Mile|REAL|acres/mile|Elevated floodplain area converted to acres and divided by centerline length converted to miles
