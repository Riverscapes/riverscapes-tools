The Hydrologic Context tool concept was conceived and written by Jordan Gilbert of Utah State University. Originally part of the [BRAT](/brat) tool, hydrology was broken out into its own standalone tool in order to provide more flexibility for running different scenarios, as well as to make it available as an input to others models (that didn't necessarily need the BRAT model).
