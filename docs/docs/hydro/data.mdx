## Data Layers Produced by Hydrologic Context

### Outputs 

<h4><a name="HYDRO_GEOM_POINTS">Hydrologic IGO Point Geometry</a></h4>
Integrated Geographic Objects - Points placed at a specified distance interval along the valley centerline. This distance is a function of the average valley width for a given stream.

<h4><a name="HYDRO_POINTS">Hydrologic Output Points</a></h4>
IGOs attributed with values for hydrology calculated within a single DGO or an aggregation of DGOs.

<h4><a name="HYDRO_GEOM_LINES">Hydrologic Reach Geometry</a></h4>
NHD Flowlines that have been intersected with land ownership, road and rail.

<h4><a name="HYDRO_LINES">Hydrologic Output Lines</a></h4>
NHD Flowlines attributed with values for physical characteristics and hydrology.

<h4><a name="HYDRO_GEOM_DGOS">Hydrologic Output DGOs Polygons</a></h4>
Discrete Geographic Objects - The valley bottom split into a sampling frame of polygons where the IGO points are at the center of each polygon.

<h4><a name="HYDRO_DGOS">Hydrologic Output DGOs</a></h4>
DGOs attributed with values for physical stream characteristics and hydrology within the DGO extent.
