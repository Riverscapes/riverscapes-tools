The Riverscape Metric Engine compiles a suite of metrics that provide information regarding riverscape health as well as practical information useful for planning and prioritization purposes. All metrics are summarized onto a point feature class (Integrated Geographic Objects or IGOs) representative of a certain area of valley bottom. Metrics names with the second prefix 'dgo' represent metrics calculated within a single Discrete Geographic Object (DGO) associated with the IGO point, whereas metrics with the 'igo' second prefix represent metrics calculated using a moving window some distance up and downstream of the IGO that aggregates multiple DGOs.


## Attribute Names 
Below is a list of the attribute names and their descriptions that are included in the IGO point feature class. This is an actively evolving list and will be updated as new metrics are added to the Riverscape Metric Engine.\

The name format is as follows: `<model the metric comes from>_<igo or dgo>_<metric description>`

- **level_path**: the NHD level path, which is a unique identifier for each stream from its origin to its end in the NHDPlusHR dataset.
- **seg_distance**: (From VBET) the distance along a given level path that the IGO is located (used for toplogical purposes).
- **stream_size**: (From VBET) the size classification of the stream (0-4) used for applying different parameters for different size streams in extracting the valley bottom.
- **FCode**: The dominant NHD FCode found within a DGO. FCode represents flow types (i.e., perennial, intermittent, ephemeral, etc.). See [NHD FCode Descriptions](https://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/op/gis/data/NHD%20Complete%20FCode%20Attribute%20Value%20List.pdf) for more information.
- **window_size**: The length (m) of the moving window used to calculate the igo metrics.
- **rme_dgo_ownership**: The dominant ownership within the DGO associated with the IGO.
- **rme_dgo_state**: The dominant US state within the DGO associated with the IGO.
- **rme_dgo_county**: The dominant county within the DGO associated with the IGO.
- **rme_igo_prim_channel_gradient**: The gradient (m/m) of the primary channel within the DGO.
- **rme_igo_valleybottom_gradient**: The gradient (m/m) of the valley bottom.
- **rme_igo_rel_flow_length**: The length of channels within the analysis window divided by the valley centerline length (m/m).
- **rme_dgo_confluences**: The number of confluences per km of riverscape length.
- **rme_dgo_diffluences**: The number of diffluences per km of riverscape length.
- **rme_igo_trib_per_km**: The number of tributaries per km of riverscape length.
- **rme_igo_planform_sinuosity**: The planform sinuosity of the primary channel within the analysis window. Channel length divided by valley centerline length (m/m).
- **rme_dgo_drainage_area**: The drainage area (km^2) of the DGO.
- **nhd_dgo_stream_order**: The stream order of the primary NHD stream within the DGO.

- **nhd_dgo_streamlength**: The length of channels within the DGO (m).
- **epa_dgo_ecoregion3**: The 3rd level of the EPA ecoregion classification within the DGO.
- **epa_dgo_ecoregion4**: The 4th level of the EPA ecoregion classification within the DGO.
- **vbet_dgo_lowlying_area**: The area of valley bottom classified as 'low_lying' within the DGO (m^2).
