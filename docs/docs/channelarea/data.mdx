# Data

## Inputs

|Layer|Data Type|Description|Source|
|---|---|---|---|
|flowlines|Geopackage Feature Class|these polylines represent the river network. The features must have two attributes, one that represents the feature type (perennial, intermittent, pipe, canal, artificial path, etc (this is the NHD `FCode` field in the United States)), and the other is the total upstream drainage area of each feature (`TotDASqKm` in the NHD)|[Riverscapes Context](https://tools.riverscapes.net/rscontext/data/#NETWORK_INTERSECTION)|
|flowareas|Geopackage Feature Class|polygons that represent larger flow areas that are big enough to be represented cartographically as polygons|[Riverscapes Context](https://tools.riverscapes.net/rscontext/data/#NHDAreaSplit)|
|waterbody|Geopackage Feature Class|polygons representing ponds, lakes, and reservoirs|[Riverscapes Context](https://tools.riverscapes.net/rscontext/data/#NHDWaterbodySplit)|

## Data Layers Produced by the Channel Area Tool

### Intermediates

<h4><a name="FILTERED_WATERBODY">Filtered NHD Waterbodies</a></h4>

A subset of the NHDWaterbody layer filtered using specified NHD FCodes.

<h4><a name="FILTERED_FLOWAREAS">Filtered NHD Areas</a></h4>

A subset of the NHDArea layer filtered using specified NHD FCodes.

<h4><a name="COMBINED_FA_WB">NHD Waterbodies and NHD Areas combined</a></h4>

The NHDArea and NHDWaterbody layers combined.

<h4><a name="BANKFULL_NETWORK">Bankfull Network</a></h4>

The NHDFlowlines layer with an attribute 'bankfull_m' added that is used to buffer the network. This layer is the network without the segments that fall within NHDWaterbody or NHDArea features.

<h4><a name="BANKFULL_POLYGONS">Bankfull Polygons</a></h4>

Polygons derived by buffering the bankfull_network feature using the 'bankfull_m' attribute. This value is calculated using region equations for bankfull width.

<h4><a name="DIFFERENCE_POLYGONS">Difference Polygons</a></h4>

The bankfull polygons with areas that overlap the NHDArea layer removed.

### Outputs

<h4><a name="CHANNEL_AREA">Channel Area Polygons</a></h4>

A polygon feature class representing the bankfull channel for the input network. The filtered NHDArea and NHDWaterbody features are combined with the buffered NHDFlowline features to create a single feature class.
