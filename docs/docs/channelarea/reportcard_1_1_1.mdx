    <th>Assessment Rationale</th>
    <td>
     The tool has been run for a wide geographic area, produces riverscapes projects that are compatible with [RAVE](https://rave.riverscapes.net), and outputs are available in the riverscapes warehouse. Documentation is still needed, but the tool qualifies for Production Grade.

# Report Card Details

This tool's [discrimination](https://docs.riverscapes.net/standards/toolStandards) evaluation by the [Riverscapes Consortium](https://riverscapes.net) is:


| Criteria | Value | Evaluation | Comments and/or Recommendations |
| :------- | :---- | :--------  | :------------------------------ |
| Tool Interface(s) |  [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) | Pass |  |
| Scale | Network (reach scale resolution, watershed extent) | Pass | This tool has been applied across watersheds in various regions; results are reach-scale performed across whole watersheds |
| Language(s) and Dependencies | Python | Pass | Package dependencies are open source |
| Vetted in Peer-Reviewed Literature | The equation used to estimate channel width in areas without NHD polygons is from  [Beechie and Imaki (2013)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013WR013629) | Partial | The width equation used in the tool has been reliable in a variety of landscapes, but was developed for the Columbia River Basin and may give poor results in different landscapes |
| Source Code Documentation | Available at [Github repository](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/tree/master/packages/channel)  | Pass | Source code is clearly organized and documented |
| Open Source | [open-source](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/tree/master/packages/channel) with [GNU General Public License v 3.0](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/blob/master/LICENSE) | Pass | |
| User Documentation | [Documentation](http://tools.riverscapes.net/channelarea/) is in progress | Partial | Documentation is in progress but has not been published to the website |
| Easy User Interface | Tool is accessed via command prompt | Partial | Most projects right now are performed by North Arrow Research analysts. For a user to run this version of the tool themselves would require advanced understanding (programming capability) and significant documentation on the process. |
| Scalability | Batch-processing | Pass | The tool can be batch processed at the HUC 8 level |
| Produces Riverscapes Projects | Yes | Pass | Produces Riverscapes Projects that are fully-compatible with [RAVE](https://rave.riverscapes.net) |

# Tool Output Utility

| Criteria | Value | Evaluation | Comments |
| :------- | :---- | :--------- | :------- |
| Riverscapes Compliant Riverscapes Projects | Yes | Pass | |
| [Viewer](https://viewer.riverscapes.net) Business Logic Defined | Yes | Pass |  |
| Riverscapes Projects hosted in public-facing [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net) | Yes. Current Channel Area projects are being housed in the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net). | Partial | There is data in the warehouse, but is provisional and wider access to the warehouse is forthcoming |
| Riverscapes Projects connected to [Web-Maps](https://data.riverscapes.net) | Yes | Pass | Current projects are viewable in [WebRAVE](https://rave.riverscapes.net/Download/install_webrave.html) through the Riverscapes Warehouse |
| Riverscapes Projects connected to Field [Apps](https://riverscapes.net//Data_Warehouses#apps---pwas) | No | Fail |  |

# Developer Intent

The current **Production Grade** version of Channel Area improves on previous versions by:
- Having an inviting [web-map interface](https://riverscapes.net/Data_Warehouses/#web-maps) so non GIS-users can discover tool runs and explore and interrogate them.
- Making it easy for GIS users to download channel area [projects](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/) for use in [Viewer](https://viewer.riverscapes.net) 
- Allowing discovery of past Channel Area runs in Warehouse

The development team envisions a **Professional Grade** version of Channel Area, which would additionally:

- Encourage more user-interaction with Channel Area outputs and crowd-sourcing of information to improve the accuracy of outputs
- Allow users to upload their own Channel Area projects
