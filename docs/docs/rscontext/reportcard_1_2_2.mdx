    <td>
      The tool can be used to aggregate data anywhere the nationally available
      datasets used to drive many riverscapes tools are available, and produces
      riverscapes projects that are compatible with
      [RAVE](https://rave.riverscapes.net). These projects are also being
      uploaded to the riverscapes warehouse. The tool needs documentation, but
      qualifies for Production Grade.

For a user to run this version of the tool themselves would require advanced understanding (programming capability) and significant documentation on the process. A "web-store" was piloted where users could request a HUC 8, 10 or 12 and get a run produced in cloud for them and uploaded to warehouse. That works and is available by request, but will be added to Warehouse 2.0. |

# Developer Intent

The Riverscapes Context tool was one of the first production grade tools. It has worked extremely well and has now been successfully run on 99% of the 15,000 HUC10 watersheds in the United States and those [projects are freely availalbe](https://data.riverscapes.net).

# Future enhancements

- Updating RS_Conext to [use geopackages instead of shapefiles](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/issues/135) for some of the vector feature classes it "wraps up". The tool has tended not to change from the parent format of vectors (typically awful shapefiles with all their sidecar files), but it does change rasters into GeoTIFFs. There are many advantages to geopackages over shapefiles for vector data. If this is done, it will likely be with one geopackage for each data type source (e.g. one for NHD and one for Land Ownership).
- Continue to add new layers that are useful to users for context or as inputs to other production grade models. A running list is [here](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement+label%3Apkg%3ARS-Context)
- Expand functionality so it can work for any user provided custom polygon extent (provided that underlyng context datasets exist for that area)
- Expand functionality to other countries (initially those that have consistent, good cartographic standards) and eventually to global datasets.
