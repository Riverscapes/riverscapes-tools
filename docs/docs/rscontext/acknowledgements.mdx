The Riverscapes Context concept was conceived by Philip Bailey. While working on several other Riverscapes models, it became obvious that similar data were used either in the models themselves, or simply to interpret the outputs.

Since the first version, several developers at [North Arrow Research](https://northarrowresearch.com) and [Utah State University - Riverscapes Assessment and Monitoring Lab](https://data.riverscapes.net/o/a52b8094-7a1d-4171-955c-ad30ae935296/) have contributed various improvements. Notably Jordan Gilbert, Kelly Whitehead and Matt Reimer have all written various code for various Riverscapes Context layers.
