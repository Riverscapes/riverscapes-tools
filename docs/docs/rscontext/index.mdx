The Riverscapes Context Tool provides watershed-scale, ready-to-use contextual data, optimized for use with other Riverscapes tools.

It gathers key nationally available datasets, processes them for an area of interest, and organizes them into a Riverscapes project. Instead of manually retrieving datasets from multiple sources, mosaicking DEM tiles, or clipping data to watershed boundaries—all of which can introduce errors—the Riverscapes Context Tool automates the process.

The resulting data can be used directly or as inputs to other Riverscapes tools, ensuring consistency across projects and saving significant setup time.

## How to Get RSContext Data

There are two ways to get RSContext data for your watershed:

| Approach | Best for | What's involved |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Download a pre-built project** | Most users | Browse the [Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net), find your watershed, download. Ready to use. |
| **Run RSContext locally** | Developers, new watersheds, custom runs | Download ~50-100GB of national datasets once, then generate projects for any HUC. See [Running Locally](./running-locally). |

See [Data](./data) for a complete listing of the layers included in RSContext projects.
