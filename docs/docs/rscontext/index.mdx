The Riverscape Context Tool aggregates contextual layers for consumption by other Riverscapes tools. Many Riverscapes tools use nationally available datasets that have to be retrieved from various sources and prepared for an area of interest. This process can be time consuming, and often the data have to be further processed after retrieving them (for example, mosaic of DEM tiles, clipping to watershed boundaries, etc.), and these processes can introduce problems into the datasets. This tool resolves these potential issues by retrieving these datasets, processing them, and organizing them within a Riverscapes project automatically. These data can then be used on their own, or as inputs to other tools.

See the [data section](./data) for a full listing of the layers that are produced for the United States Riverscapes Context tool.
