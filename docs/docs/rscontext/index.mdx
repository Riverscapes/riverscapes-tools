The Riverscapes Context Tool provides watershed-scale, ready-to-use contextual data, optimized for use with other Riverscapes tools. 

It gathers key nationally available datasets, processes them for an area of interest, and organizes them into a Riverscapes project. Instead of manually retrieving datasets from multiple sources, mosaicking DEM tiles, or clipping data to watershed boundaries—all of which can introduce errors—the Riverscapes Context Tool automates the process. 

The resulting data can be used directly or as inputs to other Riverscapes tools, ensuring consistency across projects and saving significant setup time. 

See the [Data section](./data) for a complete listing of the layers produced for the United States Riverscapes Context tool.
