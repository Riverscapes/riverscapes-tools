This page describes the **output layers** produced by RSContext for a given watershed. These are the datasets you'll find in a completed RSContext project, whether you [download a pre-built project](https://data.riverscapes.net) or [run RSContext locally](./running-locally).

RSContext takes national-scale datasets, clips them to your watershed boundary, and packages them into a standardized Riverscapes project. The layers below are derived from publicly available sources, processed and organized for use with other Riverscapes tools.

:::info
This documentation describes the RSContext model as implemented for the **United States**. Similar models exist for other regions, such as New Zealand, France, and Italy. While the overarching concept—retrieving publicly available river-related data—is consistent across jurisdictions, the specific algorithms are tailored to each country to accommodate differences in government data providers.

<h3><a name="NHDCATCHMENTVAA"></a> <a name="NHDCatchmentVAA">Catchment Value Added Attributes</a></h3>

<h3><a name="NHDAREA"></a> <a name="NHDArea">NHD Area</a></h3>

NHDArea contains many additional water-polygon features. One of the more important is the stream/river feature. It represents the areal extent of the water in a wide stream/river with a basic set of attributes. These polygons typically encompass NHDFlowline artificial paths that represent the stream network. Artificial path carries the critical attributes of the stream/river, whereas NHDArea represents the geometric extent.

<h3><a name="NHDWATERBODY"></a> <a name="NHDWaterbody">NHD Waterbody</a></h3> 

Waterbodies such as lake/pond features are represented in NHDWaterbody. They portray the spatial geometry and the attributes of the feature. These water polygons may have NHDFlowline artificial paths drawn through them to allow the representation of water flow direction. Other NHDWaterbody features are swamp/marsh, reservoir, playa, estuary, and ice mass.

"The NHD Area layer split using the NHD Plus Catchment Layer, with the 'NHDPlusID' field from the Catchments attributed to each resulting NHD Area feature. This layer is intended to be used by other models when they need to use the NHD flow area dataset. The segmented geometries in this layer are intended to prevent errors in other models because the original NHD data can include vast feeatures that extend well beyond the watershed boundary extent.

<h3><a name="NHDWATERBODYSPLIT"></a> <a name="NHDWaterbodySplit"> NHD Waterbody Split </a></h3>

The NHD Waterbody layer split using the NHD Plus Catchment Layer, with the 'NHDPlusID' field from the Catchments attributed to each resulting NHD Area feature. This layer is intended to be used by other models when they need to use the NHD waterbody dataset. This is done so that the NHDPlusID field can be joined to the NHD VAA table to attribute waterbody features with the level path they are a part of.
