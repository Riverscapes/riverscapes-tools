This documentation describes the RSContext model as implemented for the **United States**. Similar models exist for other regions, such as New Zealand, France, and Italy. While the overarching concept—retrieving publicly available river-related data—is consistent across jurisdictions, the specific algorithms are tailored to each country to accommodate differences in government data providers.
