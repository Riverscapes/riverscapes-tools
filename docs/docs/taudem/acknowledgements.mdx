The Riverscapes tauDEM tool is a light wrapper around the [Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Models (TauDEM)](https://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/) developed by David Tarboton at Utah State University's Hydrology Research Group. The [Riverscapes compliant](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/#riverscapes-compliant), [Production Grade](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/#riverscapes-compliant) TauDEM, utilizes some of the useful TauDEM algorithms, packaging inputs and outputs into a Riverscapes project that can be accessed as a product of its own, or used as inputs to other Riverscapes tools.

The Riverscapes tauDEM tool was developed by Kelly Whitehead, Jordan Gilbert, Matthew Reimer and Philip Bailey.
