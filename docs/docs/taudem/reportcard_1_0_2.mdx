[TauDEM](https://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/index.html) is a package of tools developed by David Tarboton of Utah State University's Hydrology Research Group. This report card communicates the Riverscapes application that utilizes TauDEM's algorithms/scripts compliance with the Riverscape Consortium's published [tool standards](https://docs.riverscapes.net/standards/toolStandards)).
