The Riparian Condition Assessment Tool provides an estimate of overall riparian condition based on three lines of evidence: 
1) land use intensity within the riverscape (calculated in the [Anthropogenic Context Tool](https://tools.riverscapes.net/anthro)), 
2) riparian vegetation departure from historic conditions, and 
3) floodplain accessibility. 
These three inputs are combined in a fuzzy inference system to produce a single output index value from 0 (very poor condition) to 1 (in-tact condition).
