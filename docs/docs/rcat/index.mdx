# Overview

The Riparian Condition Assessment Tool provides an estimate of overall riparian condition based on three lines of evidence: 1) land use intensity within the riverscape (calculated in the [Anthropogenic Context Tool](https://tools.riverscapes.net/anthro)), 2) [riparian vegetation departure](TODO) from historic conditions, and 3) [floodplain accessibility](TODO). These three inputs are combined in a fuzzy inference system to produce a single output index value from 0 (very poor condition) to 1 (in-tact condition). 

## Output Attributes

### Channel Network Outputs (vwReaches)

- **ReachID**: Unique identifier for each reach
- **FCode**: NHD FCode for each reach
- **ReachCode**: A unique identifier for each reach from the NHD attributes 
- **NDHPlusID**: Unique identifier for each reach in the NHDPlus dataset
- **StreamName**: The name of the stream
- **level_path**: A unique identifier for each individual stream from the NHD attributes
- **TotDASqKm**: Total drainage area in square kilometers from NHD attributes
- **DivDASqMi**: Total drainage area in square kilometers partioned among diversions, side channels, etc. from NHD attributes
- **WatershedID**: Unique identifier for each watershed (the hydrologic unit code) from the NHD attributes
- **ownership**: Dominant ownership of the reach (e.g. private, public, tribal)
- **divergence**: An integer code from NHD attributes indicating channel divergence and type of divergence
- **stream_order**: Strahler stream stream order from NHD attributes
- **us_state**: The state in which the reach is located
- **ecoregion_iii**: Level III ecoregion from the EPA
- **ecoregion_iv**: Level IV ecoregion from the EPA
- **iPC_LU**: The land use itensity within the valley bottom adjacent to the reach ranging from 0 (natural land cover) to 100 (urban land cover)
- **FloodplainAccess**: The proportion of the floodplain associated with the reach that is accessible to the stream (0-1)
- **FromConifer**: The proportion of the riverscape associated with the reach that changed from conifer historically to riparian vegetation (0-1)
- **FromDevegetated**: The proportion of the riverscape associated with the reach that changed from bare or unvegetated cover historically to riparian vegetation (0-1)
- **FromGrassShrubland**: The proportion of the riverscape associated with the reach that changed from grass or shrubland historically to riparian vegetation (0-1)
- **NoChange**: The proportion of the riverscape associated with the reach that has was riparian historically and remains riparian (0-1)
- **GrassShrubland**: The proportion of the riverscape associated with the reach that was riparian vegetation historically that has been converted from riparian to grass or shrubland (0-1)
- **Devegetation**: The proportion of the riverscape associated with the reach that was riparian vegetation historically that has been converted from riparian to bare or unvegetated cover (0-1)
- **Conifer**: The proportion of the riverscape associated with the reach that was riparian vegetation historically that has been converted from riparian to conifer (0-1)
- **Invasive**: The proportion of the riverscape associated with the reach that was riparian vegetation historically that has been converted from riparian to invasive species (0-1)
- **Development**: The proportion of the riverscape associated with the reach that was riparian vegetation historically that has been converted from riparian to developed land (0-1)
- **Agriculture**: The proportion of the riverscape associated with the reach that was riparian vegetation historically that has been converted from riparian to agriculture (0-1)
- **NonRiparian**: The proportion of the riverscape associated with the reach that has experienced non-riparian conversion (i.e., from one upland community to another) (0-1)
- **ExistingRiparianMean**: The proportion of the riverscape associated with the reach that currently has riparian cover (0-1)
- **HistoricRiparianMean**: The proportion of the riverscape associated with the reach that had riparian cover historically (0-1)
- **RiparianDeparture**: The difference in riparian cover between the current and historic conditions (1 - (ExistingRiparianMean / HistoricRiparianMean)). In small, headwater streams where vegetation can't be meaningfully sampled, this is overridden to be 0 if there is no detectable land use change.
- **Condition**: The overall condition of the reach based on the three lines of evidence (land use intensity, riparian vegetation departure, and floodplain accessibility) (0-1)
- **ConversionType**: The dominant type of riparian conversion in the riverscape associated with the reach
- **Departure**: Categorical classification of riparian departure

### Riverscape Network Outputs (vwDgos/vwIgos)

- **FCode**: NHD FCode for each riverscape polygon or point
- **level_path**:  A unique identifier for each individual stream from the NHD attributes associated with the riverscape polygon or point
- **seg_distance**: A distance along a given level_path. In combination with level_path, this provides a unique identifier for each riverscape polygon or point

- **centerline_length**: (DGOs) The length of the centerline (m) of the riverscape polygon (riverscape network length)
