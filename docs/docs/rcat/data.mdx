## Data Layers Created by RCAT

### Intermediates

<h4><a name="EXRIPARIAN">Existing Riparian Vegetation Cover</a></h4>

This dataset is a binary reclassification of the LandFire EVT raster. Cells in the EVT raster that are 
classified as "Riparian" in the EVT Physiognomy `EVT_PHYS` field are assigned a value of 1, and all
other cells are assigned a value of 0.

<h4><a name="HISTRIPARIAN">Historic Riparian Vegetation Cover</a></h4>

This dataset is a binary reclassification of the LandFire BPS raster. Cells in the BPS raster that are 
classified as "Riparian" in the `GROUPVEG` field, a coarse categorization of vegetation types, are 
assigned a value of 1, and all other cells are assigned a value of 0.

<h4><a name="EXVEGETATED">Existing Vegetation Cover</a></h4>

This dataset is a binary reclassification of the LandFire EVT raster. Cells in the EVT raster that are 
classified as any sort of vegetation (grass, shrub, woody, etc.) are assigned a value of 1, and all
other cells (e.g., developed, barren rock, ice, open water, etc.) are assigned a value of 0.

<h4><a name="HISTVEGETATED">Historic Vegetation Cover</a></h4>

This dataset is a binary reclassification of the LandFire BPS raster. Cells in the BPS raster that are 
classified as any type of vegetation (grass, shrub, woody, etc.) are assigned a value of 1, and all
other cells (e.g., barren rock, ice, open water, etc.) are assigned a value of 0.

<h4><a name="CONVERSION">Vegetation Conversion</a></h4>

This is a raster dataset that represents conversion from one vegetation type to another between the BPS
and EVT LandFire rasters (i.e., from historic conditions to the present). Broad vegetation types, such as 
conifer, shrub, riparian, etc. are given a conversion ID in both the EVT and BPS rasters. The codes from 
the EVT raster are subtracted from the codes in the BPS raster, resulting in unique conversion ID values.

<h4><a name="D8FLOWDIR">D8 Flow Directions</a></h4>

D8 Flow directions calculated using TauDEM from input pitfilled DEM.

<h4><a name="FPACCESS">Floodplain Accessibility</a></h4>

This is a raster dataset that attempts to estimate floodplain accessibility using an automated algorithm.
A D-8 flow direction raster is first generated from a pit-filled DEM. Then, for each cell that begins within
the valley bottom, flow directions are traced downstream. If that tracing reaches the drainage network, all 
of the associated cells are coded as 1 for connected. If instead, the tracing reaches some sort of
infrastructure first, all associated cells are coded as 0 for disconnected.

### Outputs

<h4><a name="RCAT_GEOM_POINTS"></a><a name="IGOS"></a><a name="GEOM_POINTS">RCAT IGOs</a></h4>

IGOs attributed with values for rcat analyses calculated within a single DGO or an aggregation of DGOs.

<h4><a name="RCAT_GEOM_LINES"></a><a name="REACHES"></a> <a name="GEOM_LINES">RCAT Reaches</a></h4>

NHD Flowlines attributed with values for rcat analyses.

<h4><a name="RCAT_GEOM_DGOS"></a><a name="DGOS"></a> <a name="GEOM_DGOS">RCAT DGOs</a></h4>

DGOs attributed with values for rcat analyses within the DGO extent.
