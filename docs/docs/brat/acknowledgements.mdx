# Acknowledgements

BRAT was conceived by Dr. Joseph Wheaton, Wally Macfarlane and Dr. Jordan Gilbert at Utah State University. The original [pyBRAT](https://github.com/Riverscapes/pyBRAT) was written by Jordan Gilbert. In 2018, Dr. Chris Jordan at NOAA Fisheries funded the refactoring of BRAT into a more modern, scalable database-oriented structure. This rewrite was performed by Dr. Philip Bailey at North Arrow Research.

The latest BRAT code is part of the suite of Riverscapes tools and maintained by Jordan Gilbert, Philip Bailey and others in the Riverscapes development team. 

## Financial Support

We have been fortunate to secure financial support for BRAT from a variety of state and federal agencies, tribes, and non-profit organization that have enabled BRAT development. Most of these grants were primarily to get BRAT ‘run’ for their specific areas of interest. However, in each case there have been refinements and improvements to the model to meet the sponsor’s specific needs. We have insisted on making data from BRAT runs vetted [publicly available](./data), and to transparently make the models freely available as well as the [source code open source](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/tree/master/packages/brat)  (especially when funds are from public sources).

BRAT development and implementation for the entire state of Utah was funded by the [Utah Division of Wildlife Resources](https://wildlife.utah.gov/) (USU Award No. 130940). We are grateful to John Shivik (former UDWR Fur Bearer Coordinator) and Kent Sorenson for investing in this effort.

Initial development of BRAT was funded through a [pilot project](http://etal.joewheaton.org/gct-pilot-study-testing-the-beaver-restoration-assessment-tool-brat.html) granted to Utah State University (USU Award Control No. 120353) from the [Grand Canyon Trust](http://www.grandcanyontrust.org/) based on a grant from the [Walton Family Foundation](http://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/). We are grateful to Mary O'Brien for having the foresite to see what BRAT could be and invest in this intial effort.
