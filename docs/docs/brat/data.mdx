# Data

BRAT stores input, intermediate and output data in a GeoPackage. The two main [database tables in this GeoPackage](Advanced_users/database.html) are the `Reaches` and `ReachAttributes`. The polyline geometry for each reach is stored in the `Reaches` table. This "feature class" is then related to the `ReachAttributes` table that contains the numerous attributes for each feature needed to run BRAT.

Each column in the `ReachAttributes` table is described below. Columns are grouped into two categories depending on which [model phase](Advanced_Users/architecture.html) they are populated; input and intermediate attributes that are calculated once during the BRAT Build phase of running the tool, and output attributes that are calculated each time that the BRAT Run phase of the model is run.

## Data Layers Created by BRAT

### Intermediates

<h4><a name="30M_BUFFER">30m Buffer</a></h4>

A 30 meter buffer from the edge of the channel, representing the streamside area where beaver primarily browse for forage and dam building material.

<h4><a name="100M_BUFFER">100m Buffer</a></h4>

A 100 meter buffer from the edge of the channel, representing the typical maximum distance that beaver will travel away from the stream for forage and buliding material.

<h4><a name="EXVEG_SUIT">Existing Vegetation</a></h4>

The existing vegetation raster classified into suitability for dam building material, where 0 is unsuitable and 4 is preferred.

<h4><a name="HISTVEG_SUIT">Historic Vegetation</a></h4>

The historice vegetation raster classified into suitability for dam building material, where 0 is unsuitable and 4 is preferred.

### Outputs

<h4><a name="BRAT_RESULTS"><a name="BRAT_GEOMETRY"></a>BRAT Channel Network Output</a></h4>

The output network of the BRAT tool, with various attributes added representing model intermediates and outputs.

<h4><a name="BRAT_IGOS"><a name="IGO_GEOM"></a>BRAT Riverscape Network Output (IGOs)</a></h4>

IGOs attributed with values related to BRAT outputs calculated within a single DGO or an aggregation of DGOs.

<h4><a name="BRAT_DGOS"><a name="DGO_GEOM"></a>BRAT Riverscape Network Output (DGOs)</a></h4>
