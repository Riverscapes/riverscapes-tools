## Data Layers Produced by Anthropogenic Context

### Intermediates

<h4><a name="LUI">Land Use Intensity Raster</a></h4>
Existing vegetation raster classified into four land use intensity categories.

<h4><a name="DIVERSIONS">Diversion Points</a></h4>
Points of diversion from streams.

<h4><a name="PRIVATE">Private Land</a></h4>
Areas from the ownership input classified as private ownership.

<h4><a name="RAIL_VB">Railroad Within Valley Bottom</a></h4>
Railroad features within the valley bottom.

<h4><a name="ROAD_CROSSINGS">Road Stream Crossings</a></h4>
Intersection of the road and flowline features (where roads cross streams).

<h4><a name="ROAD_VB">Roads Within Valley Bottom</a></h4>
Roads with the valley bottom.

### Outputs

<h4><a name="ANTHRO_GEOM_POINTS">Anthropogenic Context IGOs</a></h4>
Integrated Geographic Objects - Points placed at a specified distance interval along the valley centerline. This distance is a function of the average valley width for a given stream.

<h4><a name="ANTHRO_POINTS">Anthropogenic Output Points</a></h4>
IGOs attributed with values related to anthropogenic impact calculated within a single DGO or an aggregation of DGOs.

<h4><a name="ANTHRO_GEOM_LINES">Anthropogenic Context Reaches</a></h4>
The original NHD flow lines intersected with land ownership, road and rail.

<h4><a name="ANTHRO_LINES">Anthropogenic Output Lines</a></h4>
NHD Flowlines attributed with values related to anthropogenic impact.

<h4><a name="ANTHRO_GEOM_DGOS">Anthropogenic Context DGOs</a></h4>
Discrete Geographic Objects - The valley bottom split into a sampling frame of polygons where the IGO points are at the center of each polygon.

<h4><a name="ANTHRO_DGOS">Anthropogenic Output DGOs</a></h4>
DGOs attributed with values related to anthropogenic impact calculated with the DGO extent.
