# Anthropogenic Context

The Anthropogenic Context tool combines geospatial datasets of anthropogenic features (roads, railroads, canals) and land cover classification with hydrography and the riverscape extent (valley bottom) to provide a comprehensive view of the potential human impacts on riverscapes. The tool is designed to help researchers and resource managers understand the potential constraints as well as opportunities for restoration and conservation by identifying areas where human infrastructure may be impacting aquatic and riparian ecosystems. The tool is also designed to help identify areas where restoration and conservation efforts may be most effective by identifying areas where human infrastructure is not present or is less intense. The outputs of this tool also feed into the [BRAT](https://tools.riverscapes.net/brat) and [RCAT](https://tools.riverscapes.net/rcat) models.
