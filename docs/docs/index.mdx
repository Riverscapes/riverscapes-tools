# Riverscapes Tools

The Riverscapes Consortium has developed standards for working with riverscapes related data. This site lists tools that conform with these standards and produce data in compliant riverscapes projects. Several of the tools below were developed by Utah State University and North Arrow Research, two of the core developers within the Riverscapes Constrium. These tools are also documented on this site. Tools contributed by others are also listed here and link to the external documentation on other sites.

:::info
The Riverscapes Consortium is committed to supporting the development of tools that meet the consortium's standards, and to providing a platform for the distribution of these tools. Email support@riverscapes.freshdesk.com if you have a tool that you would like listed here.

# Professional Grade Tools

The Riverscapes Consortium uses the Application Readiness Levels to discriminate tools. The following list comprises those tools that have been designated as professional grade.

# The Waterfall

The Riverscapes Consortium production-grade tools listed above can be chained together to create a "waterfall" that produces a riverscapes project. The [Riverscapes Context](/rscontext) tool is the first tool in the waterfall, and it is used to create a series of riverscapes projects focused on different aspects of riverscape health.

All models depend on an initial [Riverscapes Context](/rscontext) project that collects together the prerequisite national datasets for a given watershed. The dependencies of the other tools are shown in the waterfall diagram below. The [Riverscapes Metric Engine](/rme) collates metrics from the other tools to create a comprehensive assessment of riverscape health based on Discrete and Integrated Geographic Objects (DGO and IGO respectively).

# Support

The Riverscapes Consortium is committed to supporting users and consumers of these tool outputs. We encourage questions regarding tools and their use through our online support forum [here](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/discussions). A free GitHub account is required to post to the [discussion board](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-tools/discussions) but you can browse without an account.
