Rivers and streams form dendritic drainage networks, and segmented, polyline hydrographic networks are often the basis for modeling rivers at catchment extents. Here we have developed a family of riverscape network models, which model and calculate attributes for polygon riverscape segments. Riverscapes are defined laterally by the valley bottom extents, and are segmented into reach segments (discrete geographic objects -DGOs) that are connected across a riverscape drainage network. 

Unlike polyline drainage network models, these models attempt to characterize and quantify attributes (often zonal statistics) representative of the entire valley bottom width (or riverscape). Many of the models in the "waterfall" are hybrid - in that they include characterization of both polyline drainage network model outputs and polygon riverscape network model outputs. 

:::info
While many of the riverscape network model outputs are available for the entire lower 48 of the United States in the [Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net) based on freely available national datasets (e.g. 10 m NED DEM and NHD+HR hydrography), the models themselves are capable of being run with higher resolution, datasets (e.g. high resolution topography like LiDAR and higher fidelity drainage network inputs).

# The Waterfall

The Riverscapes Consortium riverscapes network models listed above can be chained together to create a "waterfall". The [Riverscapes Context](/rscontext) model is the first in the waterfall, and it is used to pull together data focused on different aspects of riverscape health. All models depend on this initial Riverscapes Context project that collects together the prerequisite national datasets for a given watershed. The dependencies of the other tools are shown in the waterfall diagram below.

The [Riverscapes Metric Engine](/rme) synthesizes metrics from upstream models to create a comprehensive assessment of riverscape health based on Discrete and Integrated Geographic Objects (DGO and IGO respectively).
